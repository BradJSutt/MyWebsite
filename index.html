            <p>I'm Brad Sutton and love to learn stuff.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I come from an art background, working in digital animation for the past 8 years, and I spent a few years in live television before that. 
                I grew up drawing and painting, and I've run a side business selling oil paintings for the past 15 years. 
            <br>
                I also happened to grow up during the major growth of the internet and computers as we know them today. 
                When I was younger I was hooked in, I spent every evening and every summer-break attached to a computer learning something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm now on a new path to develop a career in IT and eventually Cybersecurity. Figuring out how stuff works and getting better at it is my passion, and its the link between these two fields. 
            </p>
                I've decided to hell with keeping the things I'm interested in seperate. So on this site you'll find both an IT portfolio and Art portfolio. In my IT journey you'll see hacking projects, UI projects, SOHO labs. In my art portfolio you'll
                see some of my oil paintings and digital paintings. 
            <p>
                Thanks for checking out my work.
