            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Brad Sutton, I'm an artist and IT professional. I love creating art and exploring the latest in technology. My passion for learning and growing is the bridge between these two seemingly polar opposite fields.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've spent the past 10 years working in film and animation, art is something I'll always be passionate about. Now however, it's time for a new journey into the field of IT and cybersecurity. Although, it's not really
                 all that new to me. I grew up right at the big boom of the internet and computers as we know them today (Dial-up was a blast). I would race home every evening and weekend, spend every summer break hooked into a big
                 CRT monitor. I couldnt get enough of learning how this magic device worked, and they ways it could connect all my friends. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now I'm building on this foundation by completing certifications, building projects, and working towards an accelerated CyberSecurity degree.</p>
